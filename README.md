# Escape Velocity by HTML5 UP

html5up.net | @ajlkn

A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious
layout, and styling for all basic page elements. 

This repository contains a stripped down version of the template, free of all
its examples and dependencies and is intended to be used as the upstream for a
classic WebJar.
